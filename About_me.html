    <h1>About Preethi Karthikeyan</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student with ambitious goals and a strong drive to succeed. My journey is fueled by curiosity, innovation, and the determination to make an impactful difference in the tech world. I possess a unique combination of technical skills, creative talents, and entrepreneurial aspirations that set me apart.</p>
    <p>From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the world of technology and design. I’m currently honing my skills in web development, focusing on front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as back-end development using Java with Spring Boot and MySQL databases. With a passion for creating innovative, user-friendly websites and applications, I’m working on a variety of projects, including a Christmas Wishlist Manager and a recipe-sharing platform. These projects not only showcase my technical expertise but also reflect my creativity and ability to design engaging user experiences.</p>
    <p>I’m deeply motivated to excel in competitive programming, AI/ML, and blockchain, which I consider the cornerstone technologies of the future. I aspire to participate in prestigious programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC), as they align with my commitment to contributing to open-source projects and the global developer community.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics and technical skills, I have a strong inclination toward artistic expression, with drawing as one of my innate talents. Although I no longer practice it regularly, this creative mindset enhances my approach to problem-solving and design. I am also exploring tools like Figma to strengthen my design skills, aiming to master it over time.</p>
    <p>A disciplined and focused individual, I make it a priority to maintain physical and mental well-being through daily workouts. I enjoy reading motivational non-fiction books, such as You Can Win by Shiv Khera, which inspire me to cultivate a success-driven mindset. My time management skills are reflected in my ability to balance academics, projects, personal development, and leisure effectively.</p>
    <p>My career goals are ambitious yet achievable. I aim to secure a high-paying job after college, ideally in a field that combines my interests in technology, design, and innovation. Looking further ahead, I dream of pursuing a master’s degree at a prestigious institution such as MIT, Stanford, or Harvard. Ultimately, I aspire to emulate the success of visionary leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs by building and scaling impactful businesses that leave a mark on the world.</p>
    <p>With a clear vision, a thirst for knowledge, and relentless determination, I am committed to achieving excellence and turning my aspirations into reality. Whether it's winning hackathons, building remarkable projects, or creating opportunities for others, I see every challenge as a stepping stone toward success.</p>
